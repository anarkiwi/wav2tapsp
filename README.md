# wav2tapsp
wav2tapsp

Converts WAV files to C64 TAP files.

Hardly unique, but also somewhat easier to experiment with than having to hack ancient C code...

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ ./wav2tapsp.py
usage: wav2tapsp.py [-h] [--cpufreq CPUFREQ] wavfile
wav2tapsp.py: error: the following arguments are required: wavfile
```
